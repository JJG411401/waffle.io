## Process
### Cover Letter and Resume
Start your conversation with us by sending your cover letter and resume to
[team@waffle.io](mailto:team@waffle.io).  In the cover letter, include why you
want to work at Waffle and what you believe you bring to the team.

This is important to us for trying to assess both the experience and level of
passion relevant to the position.

After we take a gander and if it looks like a good fit, we'll reach out to start
the screening process.

### Screening
We want to learn more about you, your history, and your future
goals.  We'll ask a few questions, similar to below.  They may be different
depending on the position.
1. What is your favorite feature of Waffle and why?
1. What are you most proud of in your software career? This could be from
professional, academic, or personal projects.
1. What is a technology or technique that you have recently learned and enjoyed.
Tell us why we should learn it.

The second item we'll send you is a webtask.

Using [webtask.io](https://webtask.io) we'll ask you to put together a small app
such that we can gauge your relevant experience.  This should only take a couple
of hours. It is up to you to decide what to build. We are looking for creativity
and ability.  This is your opportunity to impress us.

### Interview
Our next step is an on-site interview.  Here you'll meet the team and vice
versa. You'll be interviewed on technical competency and cultural fit. Be
sure to checkout what we are looking for on our [Careers page](./CAREERS.md). No
live coding will occur. We will also discuss compensation/benefits at this time.

The day will loosely look like this:
1. An hour with the team lead.
1. An hour with two members in engineering.  This will be more gauged towards
   the technical side.
1. An hour with two other team members, these may be more engineering or other
   roles.  Here we'll gauge the cultural fit within the team
1. And finally a 30 minute interview with the manager.

Depending on the timing of the interview you'll get lunch with nearly the entire
team. Take advantage of this time to socialize with us!

### Coding exercise
After the interview, we'll setup a domain specific coding challenge.  We ask
that you don't spend more than 10 hours to work through it and you'll given a
full 7 days to complete it. A private Slack channel will be created for you to
collaborate and brainstorm with our team as you work through it. This is a big
task, so the Waffle team is committing to being available in off hours
(nights/weekends) to work with you. This is a chance for us to know how you
collaborate as additional requirements are discovered and to learn how you
receive and incorporate our feedback on the work.

### Demo and final chat
The final step of the interview process is a video call with you to demo the
coding exercise to the team.  Afterwards you'll have a final chat with the team
lead. This is a final chance for both parties to ask any clarifying questions
that may be lingering.
